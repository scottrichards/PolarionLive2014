<h1>Sample Testimonials</h1>
<p>&#8220;New software projects at T-Systems start with a standardized T-Systems (project) template in Polarion. But teams can customize every project taking into account the requirements of their customers, or how their development environment is set up. We believe that the balance between standardization on the one hand, and individual requirements on the other is perfectly achieved by Polarion.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Dr. Markus Liebelt, T-Systems International</p>
<p>&#8220;Using Polarion solutions, we are better able to handle the product development process end-to-end, including all documents needed in our complex and cross-linked development systems. Major benefits for us include the automated traceability, impact analysis and suspect link traces fully unified with change and version management. The biggest benefit for WaveLight is the ease of reuse (of artifacts such as Requirements) across different projects.&#8221;</p>
